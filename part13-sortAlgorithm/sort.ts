// 1. Overview
// sort ~ find, insert

//Since they can often reduce the complexity of a problem, sorting algorithms are very important in computer science.
//These algorithms have direct applications in searching algorithms, database algorithms, divide and conquer methods,
// data structure algorithms, and many more.


// some main algorithms
// Bubble sort
// Selection sort
// Insertion sort
// Merge sort
// Quick sort
// Heap sort
// Counting sort
// Radix sort
// Bucket sort
